## Sending Images

When sending media(image, video, audio, gif and document ), you can either specify a link containing  the media or specify object id, you can do this using the same method.

By default all media methods assume you're sending link containing media but you can change this by specifying the ```link=False```.

## Webhook

Webhooks are useful incase you're wondering how to respond to incoming message send by user, but I have created a [starter webhook](https://github.com/JS-Hub-ZW/heyooh/blob/main/src/hook.ts) which you can then customize it according to your own plans.

To learn more about webhook and how to configure in your Facebook developer dashboard please [have a look here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/set-up-webhooks).



### Notification Payload Structure

This is the structure of the notifications that you will recieve from Whatsapp when a certain event is triggered


<table>
<tr>
<td> Example Notification Payload </td> <td> Nested Structure of the Payload </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```bash
{
  "object": "whatsapp_business_account",
  "entry": [{
    "id": "WHATSAPP-BUSINESS-ACCOUNT-ID",
    "changes": [{
      "value": {
         "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
         "metadata": {
           "display_phone_number": "PHONE-NUMBER",
           "phone_number_id": "PHONE-NUMBER-ID"
         },
      # Additional arrays and objects
         "contacts": [{...}]
         "errors": [{...}]
         "messages": [{...}]
         "statuses": [{...}]
      },
      "field": "messages"
    }]
  }]
}
```
</td>
<td>

### Recieving notifications
To receive notifications such as customer messages, alerts and other callbacks from WhatsApp

```javascript
import Server from './classes/server'
import 'dotenv/config'

let notificationServer = new Server(
    process.env.LISTEN_PORT,
    process.env.VERIFY_TOKEN
)

let app = notificationsServer.start(async (rawData ,processedPayload) => {
  // Do your stuff here
  let messages = processedPayload.get_messages()
  let metadata = processedPayload.get_contacts()
  let contacts = processedPayload.get_contacts()
  let status = processedPayload.get_statuses()

  // Do other stuff here
})
```

`rawData` -> This is raw data straight from WhatsApp
`processedPayload` -> This is an object of `ProcessPayload` it gives access to the raw_data plus helper methods

**Note:** Beginners should work more with processed since it saves you time and minimizes errors

**Tip:** You can refactor it to look more presentable

```javascript
import handleNotifications from 'path/to/file'

let app = notificationServer.start(handleNotifications)
```

### Getting media links 

To retrive actual media link

```javascript
let message = processedPayload.get_messages()[0]
let mediaData = await messenger.get_media(message.image.id)
```

**NOTE:** The URL you get is only available for a 5 minutes, so you may need to download it and store it somewhere, or use it as quick as possible
