## Webhook

Webhooks are useful incase you're wondering how to respond to incoming message send by user, but I have created a [starter webhook](https://github.com/JS-Hub-ZW/heyoojs/blob/main/hook.ts) which you can then customize it according to your own plans.

To learn more about webhook and how to configure in your Facebook developer dashboard please [have a look here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/set-up-webhooks).
