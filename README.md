## Sending a Template Messages

Here how to send a pre-approved template message;

messenger.send_template("hello_world", "255757xxxxxx")
```

## Webhook

**Note:** I am having issues with my phone number so I havent tested this functionality fully. Consider it experimental ðŸ§ª. If you decide proceeding, you might end up contributing (Which is a good thing)

Webhooks are useful incase you're wondering how to respond to incoming message send by user, but I have created a [starter webhook](https://github.com/JS-Hub-ZW/heyhooh/blob/main/hook.ts) which you can then customize it according to your own plans. In the moment I have made it as simple as possible.

To learn more about webhook and how to configure in your Facebook developer dashboard please [have a look here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/set-up-webhooks).


### Notification Payload Processor

Given notification data you can process it like this:

```javascript
let data = req.body
let processedPayload = new ProcessNotificationPayload(data)
```

This is will help you identify things like the type of payload and has some getter functions for simplifying your work:

```javascript
let messages = processedPayload.get_messages()
let metadata = processedPayload.get_contacts()
let contacts = processedPayload.get_contacts()
```

Of the helpers are not exhaustive since this is wrapper.

### Getting media links  [To be implented]

To retrive actual media links

```javascript
let message = processedPayload.get_messages()[0]
let mediaData = await  processedPayload.getMediaData(message.image.id)
```

**NOTE:** The URL you get is only available for a 5 minutes, so you may need to download it and store it somewhere, or use it as quick as possible

For more info check [Notification Payload refernce](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks/components) and [Notification Payload Examples](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks/payload-examples)
