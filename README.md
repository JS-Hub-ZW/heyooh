## Sending a Template Messages

Here how to send a pre-approved template message;

```javascript
messenger.send_template("hello_world", "255757xxxxxx")
```

## Webhook

Webhooks helps you recieve notifications when certain events are triggered. These notifications are useful incase you're wondering how to respond to incoming message send by user, but I have created a [starter webhook](https://github.com/JS-Hub-ZW/heyhooh/blob/main/hook.ts) which you can then customize it according to your own plans. In the moment I have made it as simple as possible.

To learn more about webhook and how to configure in your Facebook developer dashboard please [have a look here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/set-up-webhooks).

### Notification Payload Structure

This is the structure of the notifications that you will recieve from Whatsapp when a certain event is triggered


<table>
<tr>
<td> Example Notification Payload </td> <td> Nested Structure of the Payload </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```bash
{
  "object": "whatsapp_business_account",
  "entry": [{
    "id": "WHATSAPP-BUSINESS-ACCOUNT-ID",
    "changes": [{
      "value": {
         "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
         "metadata": {
           "display_phone_number": "PHONE-NUMBER",
           "phone_number_id": "PHONE-NUMBER-ID"
         },
      # Additional arrays and objects
         "contacts": [{...}]
         "errors": [{...}]
         "messages": [{...}]
         "statuses": [{...}]
      },
      "field": "messages"
    }]
  }]
}
```
</td>
<td>
    
<image src="https://scontent.fhre1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/279222632_734660030860914_6012822392536302447_n.png?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=6825c5&_nc_ohc=6JRg8jSurMkAX96mfPU&_nc_ht=scontent.fhre1-1.fna&oh=00_AT-ijPsejf2Ys89V08c7qqC3I8wy1ppmk5RedBKakjDe8Q&oe=628FFFB6">

</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Notification Payload Processor

Given notification data you can process it like this:

```javascript
let data = req.body
let processedPayload = new ProcessNotificationPayload(data)
```

This is will help you identify things like the type of payload and has some getter functions for simplifying your work:

```javascript
let messages = processedPayload.get_messages()
let metadata = processedPayload.get_contacts()
let contacts = processedPayload.get_contacts()
let status = processedPayload.get_statuses()
```

Of the helpers are not exhaustive since this is wrapper.

### Getting media links 

To retrive actual media link

```javascript
let message = processedPayload.get_messages()[0]
let mediaData = await messenger.get_media(message.image.id)
```

This will return an object with a URL

**NOTE:** The URL you get is only available for a 5 minutes, so you may need to download it and store it somewhere, or use it as quick as possible
